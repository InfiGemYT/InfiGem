                <p>
                    Whilst we will take all reasonable steps to deliver your messages to recipients
        as fast as possible, we cannot commit to, or guarantee, a specific delivery time.
        Such times depend on various network and system-related factors among the various
        entities involved in the transportation of your messages across the cellular mobile
        networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, delivery reports and the originator are operator dependant features
        and so it is not possible for us to give 100% guarantees for their availability.
        We recommend that tests should be conducted beforehand when these features are considered
        to be of high importance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You acknowledge that as we send and receive text-messages via major telecommunications
        companies and Mobile Network Operators, our influence over the transmission of your
        messages is within the technical constraints imposed upon us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our responsibility is therefore to ensure that the text-messages you send through
        the service are processed correctly and delivered to the assigned entity. We are
        not responsible for the final delivery of the message, as this is out of our control
        and is the responsibility of the Mobile Network Operator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SMS that cannot be delivered within the life span allocated to them, either by us
        or a Mobile Network Operator will be discarded by the Mobile Network Operator, without
        any notice. We are not liable for any loss incurred by the failure of a message
        to be delivered and you acknowledge that damages for financial or other loss resulting
        from delivery failure cannot be claimed from Team <b>tncgroup.in</b>.Furthermore,
        you agree that message contents are deemed to have zero value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also acknowledge that text-messages are transmitted unencrypted and that eavesdropping
        of mobile phone communications, including SMS delivery, by third parties is possible.
        We also recommend that you ensure sensitive and valuable information is communicated
        by a number of communication methods.
